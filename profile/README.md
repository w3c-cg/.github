# W3C Community Groups Repositories

W3C operates this GitHub organization to host repositories from [Community Groups](https://www.w3.org/community/) - see [Community Groups Tools and Infrastructure](https://www.w3.org/community/about/tool/).

# Permission management

CG repos in this organization get created by the W3C CG Team (team-community-process@w3.org) when asked by the Chair(s) of a Community Group.

CGs can get a repo based on their shortname. If the group needs multiple repos, additional repos prefixed with that shortname can also requested, although if a Community Group expects to need many different repos, the Community Group might consider creating and operating its own GitHub organization.

By default, the repos get configured with the Chairs (when their GitHub accounts is known) being granted "maintainer" rights on the repos - the Chairs are then responsible for assigning additional rights as necessary.

In case Chairs of a Community Group have changed but the rights haven't been transfered to the new Chairs, please ask support from the W3C CG Team at team-community-process@w3.org.
